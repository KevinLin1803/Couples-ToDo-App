<!-- Turn this website into something fullStack. Research a little more into react and tailwind -->

<!-- The other thing would be creating a backend for this. A to do list with accountaiblity. Work towards dates with your partner. 
 Add words of affirmation for each task completed :) -->


<!-- Next step: let's start styling and making it look nice :)) -->

<!-- Questions -->
 <!-- what are inputs put on their own line when the parent div is set on flex? -->
  <!-- Can i apply styling on "task" above here? -->
   <!-- Use of gloabl variables? -->

 <!-- Learnings: inputs are always put on their on -->
  <!-- The spacing gets better once you connect the backend to it? -->

 <!-- I don't know if React is something I actually need? I can see how its useful for avoiding code re-use and components but mmm otherwise I'm not too sure -->
 <!-- But it's good for employability so I'll still give it a go :) -->
<!-- Refactoring this shit is a nightmare -->

 <!-- It may also be good for practice too like:
  1. Build your app using vanilla stuff too
  
  Then if you want extra practice, you can convert it using the frameworks
  
  Then build another different one using the frameworks. Could end up with 2 different fullstack projects!! Quite cool

  One to learn how to make a full stack web app. Then another one to learn how frameworks make that process easier!

  I'll probs just roll with this for now then. And check in everynow and again to see if what I'm doing is good/right

  I wouldn't mind jumping off at certain moments to try and convert it into React either. That could definitely be fun. 

  Can create the frontend using the vanilla stuff first then convert/create it to React or something. I think the only thing is 
  I wanna use more React now becuase I watched that tutorial more somewhat/kinda recently. But like yah an extra little bit won't hurt I think
